Then in 2016 Quora became a multilingual \n    platform so I started using the Italian version as well.  I enjoyed writing each day, one or two answers about\n    topics where I have professional experitise or simple human experience. In about four years of Quora experience \n    I have been writing more than 1500 answers to questions about programming languages such as Java, Python and R,\n    data science algorithms, data collection and analysis, academic research, cultural aspects of of countries where \n    I have been living in, intercultural communication and geopolitics.  </p>\n\n#### Now, as a data scientist I see the text of my answers as a dataset to analyze. Unfortunately, Quora has no API you can query to obtain the data but I found a way to download my answers through a Chrome plugin. So my Quora answers dataset contains : \n   - the date in which I wrote the corresponding answer, \n   - the questions to which I answerd and \n   - obviously the text of the answer. \n   \n\n#### The questions that I have been asking about this dataset are related to: \n   - the number of questions that I wrote per day\n   - how this number is distributed from a temporal perspective and a statistical perspective. \n\n#### In order to find some trends or patterns I have been asking questions on \n   - what are the most productive days of the week in which I have been writing more answers. For answering to this question I have been aggregating data by day of week.\n   - what are the most productive months of the year, i.e. the months I have been answering more questions. From the analysis of these data different patterns emerge so..\n   - I did a barplot graphics and a boxplot graphics respectively for showing those patterns. \n   - also a time-series plot of my activity on Quora where is shown the number of answers I have been answering per day.\n   - the text of the answers is also interesting so I did a worldcloud graphics in order to show the most frequent words in my answers. Quora also uses those words to show on my profile on what topics I'm writing most.\n   - with a pairwise correlation matrix graphics I show how the most frequent words (extracted in the previous step) are correlated. Unexpectedly two different clusters emerge.  \n   - finally I have divided the Quora answers dataset in three data files (QuoraAnswersPerDay.csv,QuoraAnswersText.txt and QuoraCorrelationMatrixData.csv ) in order to visualize the data better.    \n   "
